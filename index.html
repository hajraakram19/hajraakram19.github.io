  <h2>What I Do</h2>

  <p>
    I design agentic AI systems that break down complex goals into autonomous,
    coordinated actions across tools and platforms.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Autonomous AI Agents</strong> — Designing goal-driven agents that plan,
      reason, and execute tasks with minimal human input.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Multi-Agent Systems</strong> — Building agent architectures where
      multiple agents collaborate, delegate, and validate outcomes.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Workflow Automation</strong> — Automating end-to-end processes by
      orchestrating AI agents with APIs, tools, and services.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>AI Tool Orchestration</strong> — Integrating LLMs, tools, and external
      systems into reliable, scalable automation pipelines.
    </li>
  </ul>

    <h3>Autonomous Task Execution Agent</h3>
    <p>
      <strong>Problem:</strong> Manual task execution across platforms is slow,
      repetitive, and error-prone.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Approach:</strong> Designed an autonomous agent that decomposes high-level
      goals into actionable steps, selects tools dynamically, and executes tasks with
      self-verification loops.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Outcome:</strong> Reduced human intervention and enabled reliable,
      repeatable task automation.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h3>Multi-Agent Workflow Orchestration System</h3>
    <p>
      <strong>Problem:</strong> Complex workflows require coordination, validation,
      and error handling across multiple stages.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Approach:</strong> Built a multi-agent architecture where specialized
      agents collaborate, delegate subtasks, and validate outputs before progression.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Outcome:</strong> Improved workflow robustness and scalability across
      interconnected processes.
    </p>

  <div>
    <h3>Decision-Support AI Agent</h3>
    <p>
      <strong>Problem:</strong> Decision-making often relies on fragmented data
      and manual analysis.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Approach:</strong> Designed an AI agent that aggregates inputs from
      multiple sources, evaluates options using defined constraints, and provides
      explainable recommendations.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Outcome:</strong> Enabled faster, more consistent, and transparent
      decision support.
